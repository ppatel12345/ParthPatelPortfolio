## About Me

Hello my name is Parth Patel and I am an ethusiastic and driven nurse who happens to also program. I enjoy both the medical field and technology at the same time. I have  a specific interest in emergency and critical care medicine along with pharmacy medication utilization. My projects below demonstrate both my skillset as a data scientist but also my interests and passion projects. I truly enjoy exploring data and finding insights. 

## Work/Projects

**[Weather Application](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/WeatherApplication)** 

Weather application in Python that tells the user the weather of the city based on the user's input or zip code or city name. Many different user input scenarios are taken into consideration.
    
**[Are Men Healthier Than Women?](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/AreMenHealthierThanWomen)**

An analysis in Python that utilizes patients with and without cardiovascular diseases. The project involves looking at different health metrics and seeing if men are healthier than women.

**[Drug Database Data Connection](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/DrugDatabaseDataConnection)**

An analysis in Python that connects to three different data sources and abstracts pharmacy drug data for both data dictionary references and drug overview. Web interface and API data are utilized. 
    
**[Hotel Bookings Prediction](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/HotelBookingsPrediction)**

An analysis in Python that creates a hotel prediction model. The model is to determine the likelihood of a canceled booking allowing a hotel to potentially book more rooms than available knowing that booking will be canceled. 
    
**[Airlines Safety Visuals](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/AirlinesSafetyVisuals)**

A visual demonstration of airline safety in Microsoft PowerBI. ETL was done prior and loaded into PowerBI to showcase different visualizations.

**[Drug File Data Load](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/DrugFileDataLoad)**

A use case in Python demonstrating a data load of an unformatted drug file. ETL and formatting is show to load into a SQL database. 

**[Septic Alcoholics Data Abstraction](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/SepticAlcoholicsDataAbstraction)**

A SQL data query that utilizes different partition statements and data abstraction queries to gather all the necessary data for a retrospective research analysis 

**[Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Model](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/CVDsPredictionModel)**

An analysis in Python and ETL in R demonstrating a cardiovascular prediction model on the occurrence of the disease within a population. 

**[Pneumonia Classification from Chest X-rays Using Deep Learning CNN Model](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/WeatherApplication)**

A CNN model using chest x-ray imaging to classify Pneumonia or healthy lungs. Acurracy and sample testing performed. 

**[Place Holder 2](https://github.com/ppatel12345/ParthPatelPortfolio/tree/main/WeatherApplication)**
